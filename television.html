			Hey<br>
			I'm not afraid, I can be myself and I<br>
			Hope you can be yourself as well<br>
			'Cause I can make you feel alright<br>
			And there was so much happiness that<br>
			We were still yet to find<br>
			I said that you can call me Alex, baby<br>
			Welcome to my life<br>
			<br>
			But don't you worry, don't you, don't worry, girl<br>
			No, I'm not sure if I'm into you<br>
			The last time that you checked I was probably so sad and confused<br>
			I don't know, no, I don't know what you like<br>
			But if you're lookin' for somethin' new<br>
			I know somebody that you could choose<br>
			<br>
			What about me?<br>
			What about me?<br>
			What about me and you together?<br>
			Somethin' that could really last forever<br>
			What about me?<br>
			What about me?<br>
			What about me and you together?<br>
			Somethin' that could really last forever<br>
			<br>
			If all my friends wanna be in her bed<br>
			Then I begin to wonder why<br>
			I guess that I'd be lyin' to myself<br>
			Because who the fuck would be dumb enough<br>
			To reject an offer? Oh, what an offer<br>
			Now, two, two, ten, one, five<br>
			Couple hours can change your life<br>
			Frankie sayin', "Oh what a night?" What a night?<br>
			What the fuck is a girlfriend? I'ma need advice<br>
			Maybe I should go outside so I could get a fucking life<br>
			I made a friend and she spent the night, and now<br>
			<br>
			I'm in love and she remains in my life<br>
			And back when we spoke in Europe<br>
			I need insurance, on my emotions<br>
			I can't get hurt again<br>
			Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad<br>
			And I had no time to prepare to face my fears<br>
			I guess that it's time that I dried these tears<br>
			<br>
			But if I could just be happy by the end of this song<br>
			But if by the time you hear it, you are already gone<br>
			And it didn't go to plan, then why should I continue in this life<br>
			When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile?<br>
			<br>
			But so far everything's good<br>
			(Ooh)<br>
			Oh, oh<br>
			Whoa, whoa, oh-whoa, oh<br>
			Said, so far everything's good<br>
			No<br>
			Oh-no-no<br>
			No-no-no, no, no, oh, oh<br>
			<br>
			I want the crowd in tears when they hear this<br>
			Is that so wrong?<br>
