                I've been trying not to think about it, I can't help it <br>
                I know you don't wanna hear from me, but I am selfish <br>
                It kills me inside you can drink on Friday nights <br>
                Not even pick up the phone <br>
                It amazes me you move on so easily <br>
                From someone that you once called home <br>
                <br>
                I wish you had enough discipline for the both of us <br>
                Just because I don't know how to turn off the way I feel <br>
                I know you always fell out love so damn easily, but honestly <br>
                I don't think you ever had something real <br>
                <br>
                Until you met me <br>
                Drinks in New York City <br>
                Ooh, you looked so pretty <br>
                Think I fell in love before I even knew your birthday <br>
                Kissed you on our first date <br>
                Somehow, I knew someday <br>
                This would hurt 'cause I could never let you go <br>
                Oh, I'll spend my whole life <br>
                Missing a part of me, part of me <br>
                Oh, I'll spend my whole life <br>
                Hoping your heart is free, heart is free <br>
                <br>
                I've been trying not to think of this as something tragic  <br>
                'Cause our two paths might cross again  <br>
                Crazier things have happened  <br>
                And I realize lightning strikes just once, not twice  <br>
                And shooting stars are burning rocks  <br>
                So I spend weeks inside, drowning in these dreams of mine  <br>
                And wondering if I'm worth your thoughts  <br>
                <br>
                I wish you had enough discipline for the both of us  <br>
                Just because I don't know how to turn off the way I feel <br>
                I know you always fell out love so damn easily, but honestly <br>
                I don't think you ever had something real <br>
                <br>
                Until you met me <br>
                Drinks in New York City <br>
                Ooh, you looked so pretty <br>
                Think I fell in love before I even knew your birthday <br>
                Kissed you on our first date <br>
                Somehow, I knew someday <br>
                This would hurt 'cause I could never let you go <br>
                <br>
                Do you not dream of me? <br>
                'Cause I have visions in my sleep <br>
                I can't ever find my peace now <br>
                Do you wake up alone <br>
                And feel an aching in your bones? <br>
                Or are you happy without me now? <br>
                <br>
                The first time that you told me <br>
                You thought that you loved me <br>
                That bar in the city <br>
                I thought you were drunk <br>
                But I knew deep down that you meant it <br>
                Wish that I had said it <br>
                I was scared to let it happen <br>
                But it happened and now I cannot forget it <br>
                Oh, I'll spend my whole life <br>
                Missing a part of me, part of me <br>
                Oh, I'll spend my whole life <br>
                Hoping your heart is free, heart is free <br>
