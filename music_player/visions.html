                Visions in my head of this<br>
                You don't know the half of it<br>
                I've got dreams of looking up, looking up<br>
                High as I can get<br>
                But nothing feels like how it feels<br>
                To know these things I don't know yet<br>
                The weight of everything<br>
                And everything's a threat<br>
                <br>
                Sometimes<br>
                I'm trapped inside and I don't know what I'm gonna do<br>
                But to take on the world<br>
                Is the only thing that we know how to do<br>
                <br>
                I've got dreams<br>
                Of finding out what all of this is for<br>
                (All of this is for)<br>
                It's you and me<br>
                And everywhere we go leading to an open door<br>
                (All of this is for)<br>
                <br>
                We've made our mistakes<br>
                The good and bad days<br>
                But nothing really breaks<br>
                If I got you<br>
                Look at the sky<br>
                When you go outside<br>
                And know there is nothing<br>
                To keep me back from you<br>
                <br>
                I've got dreams<br>
                Of finding out what all of this is for<br>
                It's you and me<br>
                (And know there is nothing)<br>
                And everywhere we go leading to an open door<br>
                To keep me back (keep me back, keep me back) from you<br>
                (Keep me back, keep me back, keep me back)<br>
                To keep me back from you<br>
                To keep me back (keep me back, keep me back) from you<br>
